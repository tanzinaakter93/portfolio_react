  "thesistitle":"Thesis: One-Visibility Cops and Robber Game of Trees",
  "thesisdescription":`The one-visibility cops and robber game is a variation of the zero-visibility cops and robber game, where one-visibility means that the robber is seen by a cop when the distance between them is at most one. Suppose that a
robber is hiding on vertices of a graph. The focus of this thesis is nding the
minimum number of one-visibility cops required to capture the robber. Such a
number is called the one-visibility cop number. The literature does not provide
enough results on the one-visibility cop number. In this thesis, we consider
the one-visibility cops and robber game on trees. We prove a lower bound for
the one-visibility cop number of trees. We propose strategies to clear trees
according to their structures. We give a linear-time algorithm for computing
the labels of all vertices of a tree. The first component in the label of the root
is the cop number of that tree. We provide an optimal clearing guide for the
cop player to clear a tree. We also present some interesting relations between
zero- and one-visibility cop numbers on trees.`,

  "thesistitle":"Thesis: A Secure Approach on Retransmission Based Network Steganography", 
  "thesisdescription":'This paper gives new in-sights and directions on how to improve information security by combining steganography and cryptography. Steganography is the way to hide the existence of the communication. On the other hand, Cryptography scrambles a message so it cannot be understood. We use a cryptography algorithm on Retransmission steganography method to secure secret message. RSTEG uses the concept of not to acknowledge a successfully received packet in order to intentionally invoke retransmission. Instead of carrying a user data a retransmitted packet carries a steganogram in packet payload field. The steganogram is encrypted using our proposed encryption algorithm',
